# InfoSec Black Friday Deals 2025 Edition
I went looking for the list I normally use and it doesn't seem to be updated so I'm taking a crack at putting an Infoec Black Friday List together. I'll try to make sure the deals aren't garbage and de-shittify the list where possible. 

Inspired by: 
https://github.com/0x90n/InfoSec-Black-Friday  
https://github.com/CriimBow/InfoSec-Black-Friday  

This is my first time putting a list like this together. Even if something gets on here, do your due dilligence to ensure that you aren't getting screwed out of your hard earned money. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!!! 

 - Deals are publically announced 
 - No tracking/affiliate links. (this isn't monetized) 
 - I'll put start and end dated with each deal 

If you have additional deals you would like to add, see the instructions at the bottom of the page. No affiliate links please!!
